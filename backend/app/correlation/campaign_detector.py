class CampaignDetector:
    """
    Detect campaign candidate clusters using deterministic BFS traversal
    over the Neo4j property graph.

    Algorithm parameters (from paper, Section 3.5)
    -----------------------------------------------
    d = 2   Maximum traversal depth through infrastructure nodes.
            The query's WHERE clause requires the far endpoint to itself be
            a URL/Domain/IP node, so attribute-typed nodes (ASN,
            HostingProvider, etc.) can only appear as an intermediate hop,
            never as the final connected node. Depth 1 reaches IOCs directly
            linked to another IOC-typed node (e.g. Domain -RESOLVES_TO_IP->
            IP). Depth 2 additionally reaches IOCs that share exactly one
            attribute node in common (e.g. two Domains REGISTERED_WITH the
            same ASN).
    k = 3   Minimum cluster size.  Singleton and pair groupings are dropped
            as they are more likely to reflect coincidental co-hosting than
            coordinated campaign activity.

    Reproducibility
    ---------------
    Seed IOC nodes are processed in canonical lexicographic order (ORDER BY
    node.value) so the algorithm always produces the same partition given
    the same graph state.

    Non-overlapping clusters
    ------------------------
    Once an IOC value is assigned to a cluster it is excluded from all
    subsequent traversals.  This simplifies analyst review at the cost of
    potentially under-representing overlapping campaigns (acknowledged as a
    limitation in Section 5.4 of the paper).
